# Another recipe app

## About

This is a project I started during the neue fische web development bootcamp to try and redo everything I learned. So yes, this project needs a lot of work to become a working clean code project. But for me this is the best opportunity to preactise und mainly to run into mistakes that make me realize why several things need to be done in another, better way. My biggest learning so far is that it's bad practise to add features withough functionality. But sometimes you just get carried away with styling and imagination, espacially when getting to know styled components.
Switching to MongoDB and getting rid of some react states also is something I truly underestimated. But I feel like this is what this project is about - running into problems so I know they exist and then finding a way to fix those and not let them happen again.


## Connections

- OpenAi API to generate images for new created recipes
- MongoDB to store the data
