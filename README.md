# Another recipe app

## About

This is a project I started during the _neue fische_ web development bootcamp to apply and redo everything I learned. So yes, this project needs a lot of work to become a working clean code project. But for me this is the best opportunity to practise and mainly to run into mistakes that make me realize why several things need to be done in a different, better way.

My biggest learning so far is that it's bad practise to add features withough functionality. But sometimes you just get carried away with styling and imagination, espacially when getting to know styled components.

Switching to MongoDB and getting rid of some react states also is something I truly underestimated. But I feel like this is what this project is about - running into problems so I know they exist and then finding a way to fix these and to not let them happen again.


## Technologies and Tools

- React
- Next.js
- styled-components
- SWR Vercel
